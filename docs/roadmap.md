# Roadmap

This is a very vague roadmap, showcasing some ideas of what's about to come in the future.

### Performance hooks

Hooks using `performance.now()` and the like to maybe create performance timers etc.

This could be useful for debugging-scenarios / -applications.

### More options (possibly a rename) for useTimer() hook

Right now it has a fixed interval of 1 second, and a fixed step value of `1`. 

I suppose it would make sense to configure these values, maybe also rename the hook.
