# Intervals

React hooks that wrap [setInterval()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/setInterval) or build on top of it.
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

The intervals that these hooks create can be **paused, resumed, stopped and re-started**. Additionally, they will automatically take care of clearing any intervals that you set if the component unmounts for example.
