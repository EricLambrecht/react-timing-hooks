# useInterval

This hook allows you to do certain actions at a regular interval, i.e. **loops**. 
It is a react-wrapper for the native javascript function `setInterval`.

If you want to loop very fast, maybe because you want to animate something, you might want to use `useAnimationFrameLoop` instead, which yields better performance in these cases.

## Example

```javascript
import { useInterval } from 'react-timing-hooks'

// Increase count every 200 milliseconds
const [count, setCount] = useState(0)
useInterval(() => setCount(count + 1), 200)
```
