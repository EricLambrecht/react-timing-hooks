# Migration to v4

This guide will help you migrate from v3 (or lower) to v4. 

You won't have to change much, though. Essentially, only the interval API changed slightly.

## Intervals don't immediately start on mount anymore

Since v4, intervals won't start immediately on mount anymore.

Intervals can now be started via the returned `start` callback.
Just call it upon a button click or inside a `useEffect`.

```javascript
const { start } = useInterval(doSomething, 200)
```

Starting the interval manually is probably the best idea in most use-cases â€“
however, if you want an interval to start immediately on mount, you can still do that by using the new interval options (an additional argument for most hooks), where you can set `startOnMount` to `true`, like so:

```javascript
useInterval(doSomething, 200, { startOnMount: true })
```

This breaking change affects:

- useInterval()
- useCounter()
- useTimer()
- useCountdown()

```javascript
// APIs for the affected hooks
const { start } = useInterval(doSomething, 200, { startOnMount: false })
const [value, { start }] = useCounter({ start: 1, interval: 400, stepSize: 2, startOnMount: false })
const [value, { start }] = useTimer(0, { startOnMount: false })
const [value, { start }] = useCountdown(0, { startOnMount: false })
```

## useTimer return value changed

Instead of 

```javascript
const timerValue = useTimer(0)
```

you now have to write

```javascript
const [timerValue] = useTimer(0)
```

This is because useTimer now supports **interval controls** (start, stop, pause etc.) to be aligned with useInterval(), useCounter(), and useCountdown().

For example, you can now pause and resume a timer like so:

```javascript
const [timerValue, { pause, resume, isPaused }] = useTimer(0)

return <button onClick={isPaused ? resume : pause}>Toggle timer</button>
```
