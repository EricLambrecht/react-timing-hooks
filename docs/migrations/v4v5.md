# Migration to v5

This is a rather small breaking update. There have been changes to `useClock`'s pausing behaviour and `useCounter`'s stopping behaviour.

## Counters

The counter hooks `useCounter`, `useTimer` will now be reset to their starting values when being stopped by default. The countdown hook `useCountdown` will not change, i.e. it will still not reset by default.

However, you can opt-out of this new behaviour by setting `resetOnStop`. It's available on all counter based hooks.

Additionally, all counter based hooks now receive a new control function called `reset()`, to manually reset the counter whenever you wish.

```javascript
// If you want to keep the v4 behaviour, use:
const [counter] = useTimer(0, { resetOnStop: false });
```

## Clock update

By default, the clock will now keep running in the background when paused. This allows to show the correct time upon resuming.

This behaviour can be opted-out of by setting `keepPausedClockRunningInBackground` to `false`.
