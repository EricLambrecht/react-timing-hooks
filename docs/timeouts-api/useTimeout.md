# useTimeout

A react wrapper for [setTimeout](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/setTimeout) â€“ no leaks on unmount!
{: .fs-6 .fw-300 }

Use this hook if you want a function that executes the provided callback after the specified amount of time.

This **will not debounce** the callbacks, i.e. consecutive calls of this function will all spawn new timeouts even
if some are still pending. If you want a debouncing version, take a look at `useDebounce()`.

Pending timeouts will only(!) be cleared in case the component unmounts.

If you want to execute a timeout every time a certain value changes, `useTimeoutEffect` might be better suited.

## Example

```javascript
import { useTimeout } from 'react-timing-hooks'

// Hide something after 2 seconds
const hideDelayed = useTimeout(() => setHide(true), 2000)

return <button onClick={hideDelayed}>Hide!</button>
```

## API

### Params

`useTimeout(callback, timeout)`

| name         | description                                                          |
|:-------------|:---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| callback     | a function that will be invoked as soon as the timeout expires       |
| timeout      | the timeout in milliseconds                                          |

### Return value

A function will be returned, that - once executed - will run the `callback`-function after `{timeout}` milliseconds.
The function will also return the timeout id in case you want to clear it manually via `clearTimeout(id)`.

## Notes

This hook will automatically clear any pending timeout on unmount. Timeout's can be cleared manually as well (see "Return value").
